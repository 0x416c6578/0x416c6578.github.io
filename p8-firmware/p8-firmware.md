# `p8-firmware`
This is my first 'big' project in C/C++. It uses the nRF52 SDK with SoftDevice 132. A lot of very helpful work was done by [atc1441](https://github.com/0x416c6578), however getting the toolchain to work on Linux requires some work, detailed [here](linux-tutorial.md).  
My code is based off of [ATCwatch](https://github.com/atc1441/ATCwatch), before Aaron switched to LVGL.
