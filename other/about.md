# About Me
I am Alex, currently in my third year studying Computer Science.

## Core University Modules
- Programming I (intro to OOP)
- Foundations of Computer Science (mathematical fundamentals to an array of CS topics)
- Computer Systems I (high level overview of CPU architecture, bits and bytes, electronics basics)
- Software Modelling (formal modelling and verification)
- Programming II (more Java OOP)
- Algorithmics (algorithms and datastructures)
- Data Management (Relational model and SQL, Git, Unix)
- Intelligent Systems (classical machine learning algorithms)
- Interaction Design
- Theory of Computer Science (time and space complexity, determinism etc.)
- Programming III (functional programming in Haskell)
- Distributed Systems and Networks (TCP/IP, distributed algorithms, Java networking)
- Programming Language Concepts (execution model, lexing, parsing, programming language design)
- Software Engineering Group Project (semester-long project using agile methods)
