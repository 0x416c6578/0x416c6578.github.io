# About Me
I am Alex, a First Class Honours BSc Computer Science Graduate (79.5% average). 

## Third Year Project
- Designed and implemented a robotically controlled arch for dataset generation in Reflectance Transformation Imaging
  - Mechanical design of the system
  - Electronics design of the controller
  - With a focus on reducing cost and encouraging reproducibility
- Implemented the Polynomial Texture Mapping algorithm using a novel higher order multinomials technique

## Other Things
- In 2021 I gave a talk to my University's Cybersecurity society on an introduction to hardware hacking; slides can be found [here](https://github.com/0x416c6578/0x416c6578.github.io/blob/master/other/files/SUCSS_Introduction_to_Hardware_Hacking.pdf).
